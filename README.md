# django_crypto

In this Django project, after registering and logging in, by uploading the Excel file, which includes the digital currency (such as Bitcoin) and the date of the user's choice, by matching the API that is taken from the CoinGecko site, its price can be calculated. Show the digital currency on the date desired by the user. And if the desired date or the desired digital currency does not exist, show him an error. Bootstrap framework is also used to improve the appearance of the site. Of course, this project is a unit test for a larger project.
